    <h1>What are the advantages and disadvantages of slang?</h1>
    <div class="textCont">
        <div><h4>Slang can have many positive effects, from making students feel more comfortable and increasing motivation, confidence and participation due to a more positive atmosphere in the classroom. Furthermore, students who are familiar with slang are generally more adept language-wise – although they might struggle with writing formally. Banning slang also might feel like a personal attack on one’s identity.</h4>

        <h4>However, banning slang reinforces standard language, which is tied to greater success further in life. You wouldn’t want to be calling your job interviewer <i>unc</i>, for example, so teaching your students not to use that kind of language in certain situations might help them avoid that kind of thing in the future.</h4>
